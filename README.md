## 🐦 WingIt-MCP

> An MCP server that helps birders *wing it* — generating personalized target checklists for new lifers.

WingIt-MCP is a Go-based Model Context Protocol server that combines your personal eBird checklists with 
recent community sightings to recommend nearby species you’ve never seen — your next lifers — in a ready-to-use field checklist.

WingIt-MCP is written in idiomatic Go and implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
to make its tools and resources discoverable to AI hosts like Claude Desktop.
